**Pylux is a free, open-source, community build PS4 and PS5 Remote Play client for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and Steam Deck.** It focuses on app-store installs, Internet Play (streaming the game catalog or your owned games), automatic console discovery, and a touch-friendly mobile UI — all from one community-maintained codebase.

## Tesla Web preview

The `web/` directory contains a 1920×1200, touch-first Tesla browser interface and the
browser-side WebRTC bridge adapter. It runs in a clearly marked interface demo when no bridge
endpoint is configured. See [`web/README.md`](web/README.md) for local setup and the boundary
between the browser and Pylux's native Remote Play engine.

## Contributing

Fork the repo, create a branch, and open a pull request targeting `release/beta`. When merged, CI automatically builds and deploys to all platforms (Google Play, TestFlight, App Store Connect, Dropbox).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow and local development setup.

## What needs work

- **iOS** needs the most work — cleanup, hardening, and refactors are all in scope.
- **Android** is more stable but still benefits from fixes and polish.
- **Desktop (Qt)** is where merge pain with [upstream Chiaki](https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng) shows up most. Prefer adding new code in new files when practical and skip sweeping rewrites that block pulling upstream fixes.
- **Cherry-picks from upstream** are welcome. If you spot something upstream has that Pylux is missing, open an issue or try adding it yourself.

AI-assisted contributions are welcome — just follow good coding standards and fully test your changes before submitting.

## Why Pylux?

I told ChatGPT to name the project and promised I'd actually use the first thing it said. It said Pylux...

Pylux is built on top of [Chiaki](https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki) and [chiaki-ng](https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng). Special thanks to the original Chiaki development team and the chiaki-ng maintainers for their excellent foundational work. Pylux extends that work with a focus on app-store distribution, mobile and Android TV support, and Internet Play.
